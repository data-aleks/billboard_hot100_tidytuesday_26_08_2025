# Billboard Hot 100 Number Ones
This week we are exploring the Billboard Hot 100 Number Ones Database. This workbook contains substantial data about every song to ever top the Billboard Hot 100 between August 4, 1958 and January 11, 2025. It was compiled by Chris Dalla Riva as he wrote the book Uncharted Territory: What Numbers Tell Us about the Biggest Hit Songs and Ourselves. It also often powers his newsletter Can't Get Much Higher.
